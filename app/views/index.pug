      p Gab doesn't have advertising, but we can't exist without it. gabcade uses in-game ads to pay for it's existence and to pay the game developers building you these awesome experiences. This site can't exist without it.

  h2.text-center The Freedom To Have FUN!
  p This site is much less about the freedom of speech and communication than Gab.ai. If you want to #SpeakFreely, hop on over to Gab and get your fill of First Amendment freedom.
  p We are about allowing game publishers to bring you new experiences without worrying about being rejected from an "App Store" for expressing themselves in a way that might not be popular among those in control of said App Stores.
  p Here, for example, you might get to play a game about punching Hillary Clinton in the face, changing Laura Loomer's car tires, using a flamethrower on streets full of #BlackLivesMatter protesters or perhaps running them over with an SUV.
